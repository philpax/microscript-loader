# PlogonScript

**Currently on hold due to Square Enix shenanigans. Will be re-visiting after 2022-06-18.**

Ever wanted to solve simple problems you have with the game without making your own plugin?

PlogonScript is for you! This little doodad will load single-file JavaScript scripts so
that you can play airhorn.aiff when you die. What a time to be alive!
